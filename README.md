**Empowering FortiGate Users with Streamlined API Access**

Welcome to **forti-api**, an open-source project designed to unlock the full potential of FortiGate's API. Developed through meticulous research and practical application, **forti-api** makes it easier for network security professionals to harness FortiGate's powerful, yet often complex, capabilities.


## Project Vision


### Simplifying FortiGate Management

**forti-api** is designed to turn the intricate world of FortiGate firewall management into something straightforward and accessible. By providing a clean interface that integrates seamlessly with your existing setup, this tool simplifies complex configurations, making advanced network management more approachable for everyone.

### Real-World Impact

With tools like **forti-hole** and **forti2ban**, **forti-api** integrates Pi-hole and Fail2Ban directly into the FortiGate ecosystem. These integrations have been proven to significantly enhance network security, achieving a 97% block-rate against ad traffic with the advanced DNS filter—transforming ad-heavy sites into cleaner, faster-loading pages, and reducing unnecessary network traffic by up to 20%.


## Project Overview


### Current Phase

The core API support is in place, with ongoing optimizations to enhance functionality and ease of use. Comprehensive build instructions are on the way, along with a streamlined Conan installation process via a dedicated Artifactory server for effortless setup.

### Future Developments

The project is rapidly progressing, with plans to submit a pull request to ConanCenter's index repo in the near future. **forti-api** is poised to become an essential tool for anyone managing FortiGate firewalls.


## Engagement and Contributions


### Open to Collaboration

**forti-api** is a community-driven project, but contributing comes with important responsibilities:

- **Physical Device or FortiVM Requirement**: Contributors must own either a physical FortiGate device or a FortiVM subscription. FortiVM users, given the significant investment (approximately 10 times the cost of a 1-year UTM subscription on a physical FortiGate or the initial base price of hardware), are highly valued. If you're a FortiVM user, consider this your red carpet invitation—you're a big fish in a small market.

- **Rigorous Pull Request Process**: All pull requests will undergo thorough scrutiny. Whether you’re testing on a physical device or a FortiVM, your contributions will be subject to rigorous code reviews. Tests will be meticulously vetted for any potential harm before they reach my personal testing environment, ensuring that no changes will compromise the integrity of users' FortiGate setups.

- **Prioritizing Software Integrity**: Even though this is an open-source project, the integrity of the software is paramount. Every stage of development prioritizes security, understanding the immense trust involved in granting API access to a security device with super admin privileges.

- **Commitment to Transparency and Trust**: The open-source nature of **forti-api** allows the code to be audited by the community, which is crucial for maintaining security integrity. I am deeply committed to upholding this trust by adhering to the highest standards of software integrity.

This ensures that whether you're a FortiVM subscriber or a physical device owner, you understand the importance of your role in contributing to **forti-api** and the shared commitment to maintaining a robust and secure codebase.
